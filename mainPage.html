                         &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Daniel, and welcome to my website. In here, you'll find samples of some of my work both personal and from my school days.
                        I also included some images from some of my travels, so feel free to check those out, too! My interests lie primarily in game development,
                        and I love learning any new technology I get to try. I really enjoy Rust and C++, but I love scripting languages like Python as well.
